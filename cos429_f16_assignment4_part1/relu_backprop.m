function dLdX = relu_backprop(dLdy, x)
% Backpropogates the partial derivatives of loss with respect to the output
% of the relu function to compute the partial derivatives of the loss with
% respect to the input of the relu function. Note that even though relu is
% applied elementwise to matrices, relu_backprop is consistent with
% standard matrix calculus notation by making the inputs and outputs row
% vectors.
% dLdy: a row vector of doubles with shape [1, N]. Contains the partial
%   derivative of the loss with respect to each element of y = relu(x).
% x: a row vector of doubles with shape [1, N]. Contains the elements of x
%   that were passed into relu().
% [dLdX]: a row vector of doubles with shape [1, N]. Should contain the
%   partial derivative of the loss with respect to each element of x.
     x = relu(x);
     x(x>0) = 1;
     x(x<=0) = 0;
     dLdx = x * dLdy;
